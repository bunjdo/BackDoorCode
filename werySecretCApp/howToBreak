Goal - to get login and password for mysql server

Simple compilation with symbols:
  make simple    - compile
  nm ./simple    -  all points (for breakpoints)
  gdb main  - debugger, put breakpoint on main and then reach the line with mysql connection to grab the login & pass

Compilation with stripping debugging symbols:
  make release    - compile
  nm ./release    -  but we still have points

  way to solve:
    no more libraries!!!  objdump -p ./file  - to grab info about required libraries
    just gdb code and find info about library from func names
    https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-real-connect.html   - docs about connection to db function
    then look for mysql_real_connect
    goto that place, and check registers for login and pass we needed
    usage: x/5c 0x6038d0 - to print 5 characters

Compilation with stripping everything:
    make stripped
    best way, no simple solution
    nm ./stripped    -  but we still have points
    - now gdb fails to locate main or whatever point
    - debugging is still possible, but it is more complicated
    (gdb) info file  - the memory address of the entry point
    x/200i $pc   - list 200 operators
    b *0xCode   - break to code

    same solution here but now we hawe no func names so all func calls should be checked
