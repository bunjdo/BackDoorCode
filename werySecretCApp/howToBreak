Simple compilation with symbols:
  make release    - compile
  nm ./main    -  all points (for breakpoints)
  gdb main  - debugger, put breakpoint on main and then reach the line with mysql connection to grab the login & pass

Compilation with stripping debugging symbols:
  make stripped    - compile the same way
  strip -s a.out    - strip all debuging symbols
  nm ./main    -  no points :(
  - now gdb fails to locate main or whatewer point
  - debugging is still possible, but it is more complicated
  (gdb) info file  - the memory address of the entry point
  x/200i $pc   - list 200 operators
  b *0xCode   - break to code

  way to solve:
    objdump -p ./file  - to grab info about required libraries
    https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-real-connect.html   - docs about connection to db function
    then look for mysql_real_connect
    goto that place, and check registers for login and pass we needed
    usage: x/5c 0x6038d0 - to print 5 characters
